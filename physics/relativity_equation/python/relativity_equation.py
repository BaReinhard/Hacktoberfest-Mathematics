# Einstein's Special Relatvity Equation( change in time, mass ,momentum of an object moving at a speed closer to the speed of light 3x 10^8 m/s)
#Let the parameters be represented by these acronyms
# mass = Mass of Object
# c = speed of Light
# vel = velocity of object
# t0 = Initial time
# l0 = initial length

c= 3*pow(10,8)
